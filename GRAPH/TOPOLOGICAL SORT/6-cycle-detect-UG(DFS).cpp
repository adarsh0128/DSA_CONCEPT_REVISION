// Key Idea:
// When doing DFS on an undirected graph, if you visit a neighbor that is already visited and is NOT the parent of the current node, it means there is a cycle.

// Explanation:
// We run DFS from each unvisited node.
// While exploring neighbors, if a neighbor is already visited and not the parent node, it means a back-edge exists â†’ cycle.
// If no such back-edge is found, the graph is acyclic.

#include <vector>

// DFS function to detect cycle in an undirected graph
bool dfs(int node, int parent, vector<vector<int>>& adj, vector<int>& visited) {
    visited[node] = 1;  // Mark current node as visited

    for (int neighbor : adj[node]) {
        if (!visited[neighbor]) {
            // Visit the neighbor recursively
            if (dfs(neighbor, node, adj, visited))
                return true;  // Cycle found in subtree
        } else if (neighbor != parent) {
            // If neighbor is visited and not parent, cycle detected
            return true;

// Time Complexity:
// Building adjacency list: O(E)

// DFS traversal (each node and edge visited once): O(V + E)

// Space Complexity:
// Adjacency list: O(V + E)

// Visited array: O(V)

// Call stack (DFS recursion): up to O(V)
