// Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is used to find the shortest path from a single source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph with non-negative edge weights.

// ðŸ“Œ Key Concepts
// Greedy Algorithm: It picks the minimum distance node that hasn't been visited yet.
// Priority Queue (Min-Heap): Used to efficiently fetch the node with the smallest tentative distance.
// Adjacency List: Preferred for sparse graphs.

// ðŸ§  Steps of the Algorithm
// Set all distances to infinity (INT_MAX), except the source node which is 0.
// Use a min-priority queue to get the node with the smallest distance.
// For each neighboring node, check if a shorter path is found through the current node.
// If yes, update the distance and push the neighbor into the queue.
// Repeat until all nodes are processed.

// ðŸ§® Time and Space Complexity Analysis
// âœ… Time Complexity (TC):
// Let:
// V = number of vertices
// E = number of edges
// Each node is pushed and popped once â†’ O(V log V)
// Each edge may be relaxed once â†’ O(E log V) (due to priority queue)
// ðŸ”¸ Overall:
// O((V + E) * log V)

// âœ… Space Complexity (SC):
// Distance array â†’ O(V)
// Priority queue â†’ up to O(V)
// Adjacency list â†’ O(V + E)
// ðŸ”¸ Overall:
// O(V + E)

// ðŸ“Œ Notes
// Works for directed or undirected graphs (just add reverse edge if undirected).
// Only works when all edge weights are non-negative.
// You can use a set instead of a priority_queue for dynamic updates, but it's slightly slower.

// Use case: Finding the shortest or fastest route from one location to another.
// Example: Google Maps or GPS in cars uses Dijkstra (or optimized versions like A*) to calculate routes avoiding traffic or roadblocks.
// Why Dijkstra? It finds the minimum distance path in a graph of roads and intersections.

// A priority queue (min-heap) is used in Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm to efficiently select the node with the smallest tentative distance (i.e., the closest unvisited node). This is the key step in the algorithm's greedy approach.
// ðŸ’¡ Intuition
// Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm repeatedly picks the "closest" node that hasn't been processed yet.
// A naive approach would scan all nodes every time to find the minimum distance â†’ O(VÂ²) time
// A priority queue gives us the node with the minimum distance in O(log V) time, greatly improving efficiency.
